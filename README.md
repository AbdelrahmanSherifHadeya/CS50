# CS50
CS50 is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/   
taught in Harvard and Yale and it's open for free in Edx   
https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science   
I've enrolled in this course in 2018 and stopped, tried to start over in 2019 and stopped, started again 18.3.20  and hopefully will finish it.  
# course main languages are C and python, keep in mind it's just an introduction
- ## why posting the solutions here   
  1. I can look at them in the future and see how bad was my code, and even learn to work with github.  
  2. Great people can help me make the code less aweful, hopefully.  
  3. Some students may find this helpful or give them an idea on how to solve some of the problems, or they may help me write better code.  
  # By all means this isn't for cheating no way Harvard or Yale student will cheat from here and all the online learners don't need to cheat we already want to learn this
 ## First 5 problems are written in c language
