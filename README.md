//I've enrolled in this course in 2018 and stopped, tried to start over in 2019 and stopped, started again 18.3.20 and hopefully will  
//will finish it.  
//This is my solutions through out the course for 3 reasons  
//1-I can look at them in the future and see how bad was my code.  
//2-Great people can help make the code less aweful  
//3-Some students may find this helpful or give them an idea how to solve the problem  
 # By all means this isn't for cheating no way Harvard or Yale student will cheat from here and all the online learners don't need to cheat we already want to learn this
